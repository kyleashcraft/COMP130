# Recursion

Technique used to solve series of problems that are smaller versions of itself. Ex: Fibonacci sequence, factorials

Unending recursion results in a stack overflow, crashing the program


Factorial example

1! = 1 (base case)
2! = 2 * 1 = 2 * 1!
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 3 * 2!
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4 * 3!
...

more generally: n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
 = n * (n-1)! = general case

Recursion should be favored over loops, generally more elegant solution

Tower of Hanoi is a famous recursion example problem

factorial example in c++
```c++
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int fact (int num)
{
  if ( num <= 1 ) return 1; //base case
  else return num * fact (num - 1); //general case
}

int main(){
  cout << "Factorial of 4: " << fact(4);

  return 0;
}
```

Would print: `Factorial of 4: 24`

Recursive calls work as binary trees
			fib(5)
		fib(4)			fib(3)
	fib(3)		fib(2)	  fib(2)     fib(1)
 fib(2)     fib(1)

fib(1) and fib(2) being base cases of the fibonacci sequence (looks like tree traversal, just a way to illustrate execution hierarchy)

recursion increases intuitiveness of code at the cost of runtime

max value in an array using recursion

```c++
int max(int arr[], int fromIndex, int toIndex){
  if (fromIndex == toIndex)
    return arr[fromIndex];
  else
  {
    int firstItem = arr[fromIndex];
    int returnedItem = max(arr, fromIndex + 1, toIndex);
    if (returnedItem > firstItem)
      return returnedItem;
    else
      return firstItem
  }
}
