GDP is commonly used as an indicator of the economic health of a country, as well as a gauge of a country's standard of living. Since the mode of measuring GDP is uniform from country to country, GDP can be used to compare the productivity of various countries with a high degree of accuracy. Adjusting for inflation from year to year allows for the seamless comparison of current GDP measurements with measurements from previous years or quarters. In this way, a nation’s GDP from any period can be measured as a percentage relative to previous years or quarters. When measured in this way, GDP can be tracked over long spans of time and used in measuring a nation’s economic growth or decline, as well as in determining if an economy is in recession. GDP’s popularity as an economic indicator in part stems from its measuring of value added through economic processes. For example, when a ship is built, GDP does not reflect the total value of the completed ship, but rather the difference in values of the completed ship and of the materials used in its construction. Measuring total value instead of value added would greatly reduce GDP’s functionality as an indicator of progress or decline, specifically within individual industries and sectors. Proponents of the use of GDP as an economic measure tout its ability to be broken down in this way and thereby serve as an indicator of the failure or success of economic policy as well. For example, from 2004 to 2014 France’s GDP increased by 53.1%, while Japan's increased by 6.9% during the same period.
